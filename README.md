### Remarks
The page size has been cut because the footer has been made smaller due to the always visible side-navigation bar.
Furthermore, the contents' size has also been reduced and made more in line with latest trends which are captivating users with moving items on screen.
Lastly, partners were introduced at the bottom to prove validity of the brand to help stand out as well.

## Comparison Mobile
The mobile version is generally similar to the desktop one so I'll cut the preview short and show distinct features.

### Remarks
As you can see the mobile version has different menue styles and the bottom navbar.
The biggest reason for that is to have a seamless mobile experience as nearly all applications use bottom bars so the user won't have to learn a new pattern but instead, will use an existing one.
Furthermore, the biggest difference in the menu is the dropdown list.
Instead of having tiny arrows to press to expand and contract the menu, the user can now press the whole title and expand/collapse using that.
On the other hand, if the uses wishes to access the content which was formerly available by clicking the title e.g. "Products & Services", it will be available as a subitem in the list.

### Summary
The optimization of the webpage for performance yielded faster results in all speed metrics.
The size of bundles has been reduced.
